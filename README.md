# Crypto-Volatility-Explorer
This python script allows you to easily identify the most volatile cryptocurrencies and view their performance. 

## Description
Running this script will automatically pull the most recent 24h, 7 day, and 30 day data for the top 250 coins on CoinGecko, and show the top ten winners and losers over the period.

You can then zoom in on any specific coin by putting the coin name into the input to see the 30 day candlestick graph.
